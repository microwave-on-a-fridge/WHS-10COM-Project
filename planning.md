# 10COM code planning thing
Planning for my 10COM JS project.
## Main idea:
I have 2 main ideas but I'm not yet sure which one I'll actually end up making.

My first idea is some sort of **rhythm game**. I would probably make it some sort of 4K VSRG (4 key vertical scrolling rhythm game), but I'm not yet sure if I'll make it or not.

My other idea is to make some sort of **vertical shooter**, something like Raiden or Touhou. I would add support for keyboard movement and mouse movement to support both playstyles, and add different levels probably.

I'll probably end up going with the vertical shooter idea so lets just roll with that for now.

#### Different components of the vertical shooter:

- Player

Obviously there needs to be a playable character for you to be able to control.

- Enemies

There need to be enemies to fight as well, otherwise there won't be much point in playing the game.

- Bullets

Characters need to shoot something to be able to inflict damage to each other.

- Background image

Preferably something that could scroll and be animated so that it doesn't look so static.

- Music??

Maybe I'll add some music of some sort idk.

## Schedule (how I'll manage my time):

- Week 1

Probably just focus on planning for this week and maybe get started on some of next weeks work.

- Week 2

Begin work on player collision and movement probably, and maybe work a little bit on adding enemies.

- Week 3

Continue working on enemies and begin work on bullets.

- Week 4

Probably refine gameplay a little bit and maybe work on some QOL features like being able to customize your controls and change difficulty a little bit.

- Week 5

Continue adding QOL features and if anything else needs more work then maybe work on that a little bit. At the end of the week I might try to evaluate my work a little bit and see if its garbage or not.

- Week 6

idk
